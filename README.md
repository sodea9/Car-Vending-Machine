# Car-Vending-Machine
Made for CICS 160 at UMass Amherst

Implements a custom Queue class to be used for a car vending machine system. We didn't have to implement the system itself but design and apply the ADTs for the cars and fleet. This system has three types of cars, gasoline, electric, and hybrid, and can process requests based on the type of car requested. It will return one from its inventory if in stock.
